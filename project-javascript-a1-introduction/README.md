## Project Title: Marksheet

1. Create a html file with your name like john.html
2. Add current code to that file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      // your code here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. Use console.log to log these info in the console.

| Subject  | Full Marks | Pass Marks | Obtained |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Math     | 100        | 50         | 80       |
| Science  | 100        | 50         | 60       |
| Computer | 100        | 50         | 40       |
| Average  | 60         |

Note:

- No need to show lines
- Do not use variables
- Average can not be 60 itself. use + operator to sum marks and / operator to calculate the average.
- User `\t` to make space between columns. First line would be like this:

```
console.log("Subjects \t Full Marks \t Pass Marks \t Obtained");
```
