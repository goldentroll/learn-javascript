## Project Definition

Marksheet

1. Create a html file with your name like john.html
2. Add current code to that file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script>
console.log("Subjects \t Full Marks \t Pass Marks \t Obtained");
</script>
</body>
</html>

```
3. Use console.log to log these info in the console.

| Subject  | Full Marks |Pass Marks |Obtained |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Math  | 100  | 50  | 80  |
| Science  | 100  | 50  | 60  |
| Computer  | 100  | 50  | 40  |
| Average  | 60  |




Note:
* No need to show lines
* Do not use variables
* Average can not be 60 itself. use + operator to sum marks and / operator to calculate the average.
* User `\t` to make space between columns. First line would be like this:
```
console.log("Subjects \t Full Marks \t Pass Marks \t Obtained");
```
