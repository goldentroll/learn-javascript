College Cost Calculator

1. Create a html file with your name like john.html
2. Add current code to that file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script>

3. For a 4 years college degree, define two variables:
* Annual cost: $35000
* Inflation rate:  %5

All variables are number.

4. Calculate the Total Cost for a 4 years college degree and log it into console like this:

"For a 4 years college degree with Annual cost:($`anualCost`) and Inflation rate: (`inflationRate`), You have to pay (`totalCost`)."

5. Imagine you have 5 years to save money for college. How much do you need to save annually to afford the college cost? Log the result into console like this:

"You need to save $(`annualSaving`) annually for $(`yearsUntilCollege`) years."
